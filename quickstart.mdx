## End User - B2B

- Maintained \*\*100% client retention \*\*and **100% SLA adherence** across all end user accounts from SMB to F500 during 2019-2025.
- Flipped a F500 engineering firm from a **half a billion dollar competitor** with a \*\*\$30k \*\*network infrastructure sale. This was within 2 months of being in sales.
- Over time became sole vendor for \*\*~80% \*\*of my SMB and Mid Market accounts. I attribute this to my dependability and again product knowledge. One of my accounts explicity stated on an email to his CEO "Nick is the only vendor I will work with for our refurbished infrastructure"

## VAR/Service Provider - B2B2B

- Like mentioned in overview, was able to get our vendor rank within one key account to **5/220.**
- Maintained #1 vendor rank for quality and service within all key service provider accounts. Product knowledge and hyper-responsiveness is what pushed me ahead of my comp.
- Closed my "moby dick" account after 5 years through referall from another account I targeted for that sole purpose.
- Achieved and maintained **.4% DOA rate** (dead on arrival) amongst VAR/SP accounts where \*\*industry average is 5-6%. \*\*

## Product & Market Knowledge

- Took an educated risk and brought in 160 units of an EOL storage product that generated the aforementioned \*\*\$250k \*\*in gravy in 2023. Prior to me bringing them in we had sold 8 in the last 10 years.
- Became internal product expert on 3PAR, Nimble, Isilon, Sun/Oracle, and SuperMicro. This allowed us to sell fully tested controllers and blades which on average sold for double our cost.
- Was one of 5 people in north america that could configure systems from HP9000/superdome era to current gen systems.

## General Sales W's

- Was consistently producing more monthly revenue than the 3 most recent hires \*\*combined \*\*within the first year. \*\*All of which had 3-5 year tenures.
- Got called Nick **"the hitman"** Littler by one of my vendors. This was due to my purchase of what we call "wild card" items in the game. I bought all of his before the price went up by 10x and stayed there for the next 18 months.
- BNlah blha blah blah **Test test blah** blahg blah **test test**

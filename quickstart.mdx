## End User - B2B

- Maintained 100% client retention and **100% SLA adherence** across all end user accounts from SMB to F500 during 2019-2025.
- Flipped a F500 engineering firm from a **half a billion dollar competitor** starting with a \$30k network infrastructure sale. This was within 2-3 months of being in sales.
- Over time became sole vendor for **~80%** of my SMB accounts. I attribute this to my dependability and product knowledge. One of my customers explicity stated on an email to his CEO "Nick is the only vendor I will work with for our refurbished infrastructure"

## VAR/Service Provider - B2B2B

- Like mentioned in overview, was able to get our vendor rank within one key account to **5/220.**
- **Maintained #1 rank for quality and service within all key service provider accounts**. Product knowledge, attention to detail, and hyper-responsiveness is what pushed me ahead of my comp.

- Achieved and maintained **\<.4% DOA rate** (dead on arrival) amongst VAR/SP accounts where industry average is 5-6%.

## Product & Market Knowledge

- Took an educated risk and brought in 160 units of an EOL storage product that generated the bulk of the **\$250k** in gravy in 2023. Prior to me bringing them in we had sold 8 in the last 10 years. I took the risk based on information from customers, increased demand, and low cost of entry.
- Became internal product expert on 3PAR, Nimble, Isilon, Sun/Oracle, and SuperMicro. This allowed us to sell fully tested controllers and blades which on average sold for double our cost.

## What I Sold & Did

When I first started IGS was at its core a broker of refurbished hardware to service companies - that was our sole ICP. Over the years I was able to expand my capabilities to become a true **"One stop shop"** for streamlining IT hardware operations for my end user customers, \*\*sort of like what Mintlify does \*\*with documentation/knowledge management.

- **Server, Storage, Networking, and Power hardware (Our Core Offering)**
  - This includes spare parts to fully configured storage arrays, HPC clusters, UPS systems, and network buildouts. Both refurbished and recently I was taking advantage of renew hardware and discount deals on Brand New.
    - I personally configured systems older than me to systems released within the last year, and helped test them with my technicians.
- \*\*IT Infrastructure Maintenance \*\*
  - I looked for customers that kept equipment in production for 3+ years and offer them hardware maintenance at around 50% the cost of the OEM for year 3 and onward. (OEM = Original Equipment Manufacturer- think Dell, HPE, CISCO etc...).
    - I handled the parts and engineer dispatching for all my support tickets. For certain accounts I would go on-site to do the break/fix work myself as I always felt it left me a leg up on any other vendor trying to get in the same account. Going the extra mile never leaves a bad impression
- \*\*IT Asset Disposal (ITAD) & Reverse Logistics \*\*
  - I sold ITAD services to customers looking to retire their IT assets in an environmentally friendly manner. This eventually got tougher over the years as compliance started to rise in importance for companies.
    - I would go on-site and decommission the assets with my engineers, set up secure transportation back to IGS's facility, then audit and help my team provide certificates of destruction or erasure on data bearing devices.

Since IGS was a small company I was very fortunate to be able to have basically a free range accounts I could target/sell to. I set up all my lists, found all my contacts, and set up all my outreach messaging and cadences myself.

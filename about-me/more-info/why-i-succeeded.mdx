# Mentality

## Mario Kart Ghost Salesman

I went the extra mile whenever possible in my customer interactions to lengthen the gap between me and the competing AE behind me in an account. I always saw a ghost car trailing me in my accounts waiting for one slip up to take my place. Might be disordered in some way but I think it helped.

## 3 P's - Persistence, Patience, and Product Knowledge

You have to be persistent and patient in your pursuit of product knowledge, and you have to have all three P's to consistently do a good job selling.

## Selling With My Customers

I think this mentality helped the most in my F500 and Enterprise accounts. Really early on I learned its not only your competing vendors, but also competing solutions/initiatives working against your deal as well. I learned to always speak in their terms and get them all the documentation they needed to be able to confidently sell it to their internal stakeholders (IT Manager -\> CTO etc...)

## Luck

I have always liked the saying **"luck is when preparation meets opportunity"**. What that meant for me was always going the extra mile on account research, always answering the phone, and being persistent in my outreach of my key accounts.

## Integrity

I always made sure to do the right thing for my customers when they were not watching. That meant notifying them of data bearing devices that they missed in audit, or extra components that others would call "Freebies".

## \*\*\*Going The Extra Mile\*\*\* (Biggest Factor In My Success)

Every single opportunity I had to make my customers feel like they were the only customer I had I would make sure to take it and knock it out of the park. Things like going onsite for break/fix work, personally sending them tracking emails for orders, and making sure I would respond in a timeframe that I would want someone to respond to me in.

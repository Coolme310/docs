title: "Who I Sold To"
description: "Since IGS was a small org, I had free range of what companies I could sell to and where. As long as they were not another reps customer, they were free game. I also had full control over my outbound messaging and sequencing since most of the messaging we had in place was for our service company ICP. Over time I got to work on some fascinating projects with some really cool people."
